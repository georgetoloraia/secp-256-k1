'''
You have a circle, and you're considering a range for the radius from 1 to 2^256 (which is a vast range).
You have a starting point G.
You have a random number N, which seems to indicate the number of steps you're taking from point G.
You want to find the point X, which is reached by moving N steps from point G.
Given the huge numbers involved and the abstract nature of the problem (particularly without a specific operation defined for 'moving from G'),
the code for this could be more symbolic or illustrative rather than practical.

In this code:

We're simply incrementing current_position starting from G for N times. 
This is a highly simplified stand-in for whatever your actual 'movement' operation might be.
We're checking if we've reached X after N steps from G.
