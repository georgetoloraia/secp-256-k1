'''
In this code:

We use the modulus operator % with MAX_VALUE (2^256)
to ensure that current_position wraps around to the beginning after reaching the maximum value, simulating movement on a circle.
This is still a conceptual illustration. 
In a real-world scenario, the 'steps' might represent a more complex operation.
Remember, this is still a highly simplified representation. 
In a practical, meaningful scenario, you would need specific rules or operations that define how you 'move' from G. 
The 'circle' here is a metaphor; in actual mathematical or computational problems, especially those involving large numbers or cryptography,
the operations are usually more complex and specifically defined.
