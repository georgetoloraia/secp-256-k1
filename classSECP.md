# Classes and Functions:

### ECPoint Class:

- Represents a point on an elliptic curve.
- Parameters:
- - x (int): The x-coordinate of the point.
- - y (int): The y-coordinate of the point.
- - infinity (bool): A flag indicating whether the point is the point at infinity (the identity element for the group operation on the curve).

# Secp256k1 Class:

- Represents the secp256k1 elliptic curve and provides methods for elliptic curve operations.
- ### Attributes:
- - p, a, b: Define the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b over the finite field Fp.
- - G: The base point on the curve, used for generating public keys from private keys.
- - n: The order of the base point G.
- - h: The cofactor of the curve.

# point_add Static Method:

- Performs point addition on the elliptic curve.
- ### Parameters:
- - p1 (ECPoint): The first point.
- - p2 (ECPoint): The second point.
- ### Returns:
- - (ECPoint): The result of adding p1 and p2.
- ### Details:
- - Handles special cases like the point at infinity and the addition of a point to its reflection across the x-axis.
- - Calculates the slope (lam) and the resulting point's coordinates using elliptic curve addition formulas.

# scalar_mult Static Method:

- Performs scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve (multiplying a point by an integer).
- ### Parameters:
- - k (int): The scalar (integer) to multiply the point by.
- - point (ECPoint): The point to be multiplied.

- ### Returns:
- (ECPoint): The result of multiplying point by k.

- ### Details:
- Uses a simple and unoptimized method for scalar multiplication (not resistant to timing attacks).
- Iteratively doubles the point and adds it to the result based on the binary representation of k.

# generate_public_key Static Method:

- Generates a public key from a given private key using scalar multiplication on the base point G.
- ### Parameters:
- - private_key (int): The private key (a large, randomly chosen integer).

- ### Returns:
- - (ECPoint): The generated public key.

# Example Usage:

- Demonstrates how to use the Secp256k1 class to generate a public key from a given private key.
- Prints the x and y coordinates of the generated public key in hexadecimal format.

# Important Notes:
- The implementation is basic and intended for educational purposes. It lacks optimizations and security features necessary for real-world cryptographic applications.
- The point_add and scalar_mult methods do not implement all the necessary precautions to be secure against side-channel attacks like timing attacks.
- In a real application, private keys should be large, randomly generated numbers, securely stored, and never disclosed.
- For any serious cryptographic needs, it's highly recommended to use well-established libraries that are thoroughly tested and reviewed for security.
